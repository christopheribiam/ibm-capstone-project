# Predicting Rocket Launch Prices
## IBM Professional Certification Capstone Project

One of the technological advancements today is the ease of accessibility that comes with space travel. Space travel has improved in accessibility since Yuri Gagarin left the earth and Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin touched boots on the moon.
Space travel is nearing full scale commercialization and rocket providers are striving to achieve this feat. 

The company that stands out as the most successful amongst other rocket providers is SpaceX, and what separates them from their competitors is:
- Sending spacecrafts to the International Space Station
- Harboring Starlink, a satellite Internet constellation that provides satellite Internet access coverage to multiple countries, and to SpaceX itself.
- Sending manned missions to space.

The major difference between SpaceX and other rocket providers is that it is relatively inexpensive. 
SpaceX boasts of the Falcon 9 rocket launches on their website and it cost about $62 million. Other rocket providers cost upwards of $165 million for each rocket.
The reason why SpaceX saves a hundred mmillion dollars plus is because they can reuse the first stage.

### Goal of the project
- To determine if the first stage of a rocket will land, so that we can determine the cost of a launch.

### Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project is gotten from IBM's Skills Network Labs
